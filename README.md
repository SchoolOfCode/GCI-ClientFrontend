# School of Code Application Portal

Hello! We are Git Commitment Issues, welcome to our project. This project is a web application that serves as an Application Portal for potential new students to apply to join the School of Code!

The problem we faced was that the current application process was manual, slow and had a long feedback loop. Feedback we received from our research said that students weren't sure how long the application was, which stage they were current at or when they would be assessed. 

We set up an end-to-end process where applicants can go through the entire application within the same portal, being sure of which stage they were currently at, at all times. As a stretch goal, we also set up an Admin portal where staff members
could review and give instant feedback any any application, including making a decision over whether to invite to interview.
